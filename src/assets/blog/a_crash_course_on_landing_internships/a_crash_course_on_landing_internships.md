Do a quick Google search for "how to get a software engineering internship" and "how to get an electrical engineering internship". The software engineers (SWE) get tons of online resources, blog posts, communities, etc. detailing every step of the process, all the tricks of the trade, while we get next to nothing. Well not anymore! I've followed these types of posts in the software engineering (SWE) community for a long time and they've been super helpful to myself and tons of others. It's time to share this tradition forward to the electrical engineering communites. Here's a quick crash course based off of my experiences landing offers at [insert obligatory internship post flex companies here] Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Northrop Grumman, and more through 100+ interviews and 500+ applications.

I honestly have *wayyy* too much to write about, in fact this post is barely scratching the surface. At the time of first writing this, I have my whole "How to Land an Electrical Engineering Internship" series of posts that's only like 1/10th completed and has already ammassed ~20,000 words/40 pages. I'm not exactly sure how long those posts will eventually end up, but certainly looking like 100,000+/200 words. Ain't no body tryna read a book and I'm certianly not trying to write a book. I'm honestly not sure if I'll even ever finish those, so this shorter guide is better than no guide at all. I say "shorter", but I'm shooting for ~10,000 words/20 pages. This shorter post will consolidate the main ideas of the entire process and you'll find much more detail in their dedicated posts.
