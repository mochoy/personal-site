Do a quick Google search for "how to get a software engineering internship" and "how to get an electrical engineering internship". The software engineers (SWE) get tons of online resources, blog posts, communities, etc. detailing every step of the process, all the tricks of the trade, while we get next to nothing. Well not anymore! I've followed these types of posts in the software engineering (SWE) community for a long time and they've been super helpful to myself and tons of others. It's time to share this tradition forward to the electrical engineering communites. Here's a quick crash course based off of my experiences landing offers at [insert obligatory internship post flex companies here] Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Northrop Grumman, and more through 100+ interviews and 500+ applications.

I honestly have *wayyy* too much to write about, in fact this post is barely scratching the surface. At the time of first writing this, I have my whole "How to Land an Electrical Engineering Internship" series of posts that's only like 1/10th completed and has already ammassed ~20,000 words/40 pages. I'm not exactly sure how long those posts will eventually end up, but certainly looking like 100,000+/200 words. Ain't no body tryna read a book and I'm certianly not trying to write a book. I'm honestly not sure if I'll even ever finish those, so this shorter guide is better than no guide at all. I say "shorter", but I'm shooting for ~10,000 words/20 pages. This shorter post will consolidate the main ideas of the entire process and you'll find much more detail in their dedicated posts. 

Here are the links to each post, updated as they come out. I'll divide this post similarly, so you can check out  

1. The Internship Mindset: Why do you even need an internship? It's so intimidating!
2. Pre-Application: There are so many things to do before even sending out your first application
3. Your Application: What your application needs and how can you stand out
4. Applying: How to spam applications
5. That awkward time between applications and interviews: Scheduling interviews, dealing with recruiters, coordinating timelines, it's all here!
6. Interviews: Cracking the EE interview!
7. The Offer!: Receiving an offer may not be the end yet
8. Closing: Final and misc. thoughts

# Disclaimers

- First of all, this post will be based off of my experience, so there's going to be tons of inherit biases there. The internship process may differ between industry, company, country/location, etc. but my internship search experience is pretty broad and I'll be able to capture and document quite a bit.
- I will be drawing many comparisons to the software engineering (SWE) process because their processes are very similar to our's, but they just have way more resources.

# 1. The Internship Mindset

In my experience, EE students don't hold that same sense of rigor and determination to land internships compared to SWE students, we don't really have that same culture. To motivate other students, I like to bring up two main points, money and experience. 

## Money

I often like to mention money first because so many students (myself included!) get really motivated when they learn how much money is on the line. For some numbers,here's what the compensation breakdown looks like for my return intern offer at Microsoft (which was SWE, but HWE/EE gets the same TC):

- $8500/mo (~$53/hr) salary
- $5000 signing bonus
# 2. Pre-Application
# 3. Your Application
# 4. Applying

Applying is the process of getting your resume/application to the company and not all applications are treated equally. There's a hierarchy of how you send out your applications. 

## The Hierarchy of Applications

1. "my dad's a director" nepotism
2. Resume and pitch directly to manager/recruiter
3. Resume directly to hiring manager/recruiter
4. Referral to general applicant pool
5. "Cold application"
### "my dad's a director"

These are the main forms of applying I've encountered (well all except for 1). I mean is an application really required at that point? If exploited properly, this can land you an offer without any interviews or other overhead, since many other forms of nepotism or networking require that you display something more than hereditary luck. 

2 - Resume and pitch directly to hiring manager and 3 - Resume directly to recruiter are pretty similar but with a small nuance between them. They both can be achieved through career fair/networking event, referral, or networking and typically require some sort of interview(s) to display your skillset. They're both also much stronger than cold applying online because they bypass the ATS. 

The difference is that for 2, you actually have the opportunity to pitch yourself and talk to the hiring manager/recruiter. Your resume obviously doesn't capture everything about you, so being able to pitch yourself is extremely powerful to go beyond the resume. The hiring manager/recruiter will get a better gauge of who you are and may even skip some interviews as a result! 

Usually, getting your application to the hiring manager is stronger than the recruiter because the hiring manager is the person directly hiring you, while the recruiter is often the filter between your application and the hiring manager. At smaller companies, the boundary between these functions may not be as clear and concise. 

Some referrals forward your application directly to the hiring manager/recruiter, while others place you in a prioritized application pool. The degree of this prioritization may vary between companies and it's something I don't have too much direct insight into. Sometimes, this priortized pool may still be subject to some ATS filtering. Other times, they're genuinely reviewed and vastly increase your chances of moving forward. Either way, they're greatly preferred over cold applications. 
In summary: 

|      |                Application Type                |                ATS                | Interviews |
| :--- | :--------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------: | ---------: |
| 1    |         "my dad's a director" nepotism         |                No                 |         No |
| 2    | Resume and pitch directly to manager/recruiter |                No                 |        Yes |
| 3    |  Resume directly to hiring manager/recruiter   |                No                 |        Yes |
| 4    |       Referral to general applicant pool       | Yes, but may be different than #5 |        Yes |
| 5    |                Cold application                |                Yes                |        Yes |

Also remember that every company may do things a bit differently. At some companies, thid might not be the exact order with the exact process, this is just a generalizion of my analyis of what I've seen.
