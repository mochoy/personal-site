Wow 10,000 words in and I'm finally getting to the actual application. I hope that helps to illustrate that there's so much that happens before you even write the first line on your resume. That's why preparation and starting early is so helpful, having that time developing your skillset, building projects, etc puts you miles ahead and I can't emphasize this enough. 

There are three pillars to your application that gets wrapped up and presented to recruiters/hiring managers in the form of a resume: 

- Experience
- Projects
- Education

You can also include accomplishments, but I don't have any so I exclude it lol. 

# Resume

There's honestly so much to a resume, even at the intern level, that I think it deserves its own post. There are also tons of resources online that help you get started too, so I'd definitely recommend checking those out first, be sure to specify "engineering resumes" to get a better selection. [Here's an awesome one to start off.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JmdTN1bBOw&t) I'm going to assume you have most of the basics down like:
  
- Formatting
- Check spelling/grammar
- Use professional language 
- Use action verbs
- Highlight impact/accomplishments
- Use numbers to highlight impact
- Focus on your Strengths
- Use bullet points, not paragraphs
- Bullet points should establish context, action, and results
- Bullet points should be able to stand on their own, they shouldn't *need* other bullet points to make sense
- Sub-bullet points can be used to break down big projects or go more in-depth
- Keep it one page
- Average time spent reading resume: six seconds
- If GPA above 3.0 or 3.5, list it, otherwise, leave it off
- Round up GPA within reason: 3.999 => 4.0
- Put your highest GPA, whether that's major GPA, overall GPA, etc
- Unless you're underclassmen or you have outstanding high school experience, leave high school stuff out
- Keep everything short and concise
- Cut out useless words
- 11-12pt font size, don't do ugly stuff like double space
- Be aware of how much space you have on your page
- Three main sections: Education, Experience, Projects
- Relevant coursework under education can be helpful
- Typically order experience chronologically, but don't be afraid to put more relevant experience first
- Most important info should be in first third of the page
- Include links to portfolio, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc
- No images
- No address, but location can be helpful
- Keep it black and white
- Don't use overly pretenious and extravagent language
- Try not to repeat the same words again and again 
- Fill in massive gaps of white space
- Indicate any clubs or other extracurricular activies you're involved in
- Don't lie
- Add contact info like email address and phone number
- Use professional email adress
- Include actual links when appropriate, especially for those reading digitally
- Remove that ugly https://www. from links
- Trim links and remove uncessary characters like trailing '/'
- Try to make links hand-type-friendly for those who have a physical copy but want to check out your links. fasdgadsgdgf.com/gsdfgdfsg654664 isn't hand-type-friendly
- Underline links to highlight that they're links, not regular text that should be ignored
- Use **bold** and *italicized* text to draw attention to things, but don't overdo it 
- No comic sans or rainbow lookin ass font
- Keep it consistent. I don't want 10pt font here and 15pt font there. Everything of the same type should also have the same styles, don't italicized one date and not the others.
- Keep headings the same style
- Name should be biggest text
- Feel free to add objective statement, but I don't include it
- Use engineering buzzwords that you're comfortable with
- Know everything on your resume like the back of your hand
- Continuously improve and rework your resume
- Don't acronym-ize everything, stuff like your school should almost fully be spelled out
- Include any minors or double majors
- Irrelevant experience is better than no experience
- Try to occupy the entire page
- Sell yourself and your accomplishments
- Highlight teamwork and technical achievements
- Don't BS anything
- If you're a senior, avoid using your school email that may get deleted upon graduation

 I'll cover some of more tricks that you won't always find in your general "how to write a resume" video. Also keep in mind that I can only give so much general advice but after a point, I really need to see the resume to give good, specific feedback. 

If you know me irl, hit me up with your resume and I can review it for you. If you don't, well you're out of luck. jk feel free to send me your resumes for review, but no promises there. But if you're sending me your resume, you better have those basics and these tips here implemented in your resume because I don't want to waste my time giving basic feedback like "you mispelled this" when you should've got those on your own. 

Resumes are and should be very personalized and target your strengths. These general tips worked well for me and another disclaimer, implement these as you see fit to best highlight who you are. 

## Find Resumes you Like

It can be difficult to find creative ways to expand and improve your resume, especially after you feel that you've exhausted most of the advice out there. There's a good chance you didn't, so put that to the test by finding other resumes out there you like and improve your resume based off of those. I think this is a good way to get your resume off the ground and also further improve it from indirect input outside of your mindset. 

For starters, you could ask your friends for their resumes and do a comparison, but there's a good chance those resumes will be very similar to your's just based on many similarities and shared interests. Feel free to check out my resume as well for inspiration. If you're reading this on my personal site, you can find my resumes over in the "About" section on the main page. There aren't too many solid EE resumes floating around out there, so I would also suggest looking into the plethora of SWE resumes out there: 

- [Resumehub](https://www.careeers.org/): Student resumes, most of them are SWEs at top companies
- [Reddit r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions) [exemplary resume](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ioozqm/official_exemplary_resume_sharing_thread/) [sharing threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k90b9r/official_exemplary_resume_sharing_thread_december/): Users post resumes that have proven successful. Posts like these are posted every three months and at the time of writing this, there are only two threads, but that will continue to grow moving forward.

They actually look awfully similar to solid EE intern resumes, just replace CS with EE and you're good to go and don't put too much emphasis on languages/technologies for projects/experience. Actually there may be a few more things, but you get the main idea. 

## Include Projects!

Projects are also a great way to highlight soft/personal skills like your dedication, motivation, drive, and passion but also demonstrate that you have practical experience which often speaks louder than the standard set of EE courses every EE in the country takes. I'll go over way more about projects later on, but this section will target more on the resume side of things. 

Everything you put on your resume is an invitation for the interviewer to grill you on it, including your projects. Make sure you can actually talk about your projects: what you did, your design choices, collaboration efforts, etc. It might even look worse to an interviewer to have projects you can't talk about than having no projects at all. 

Feel free to put your school projects as well! I'm not sure how much project-based learning other schools have, but a cool class project I put on my resume is a RISC V core I built in my computer design class. Some class projects can be super practical like this one which may catch a hiring manager's eye, especially if they're looking for someone to help with CPU verification where that knowledge directly transfers over. Make sure you know the ins and out of that project though! Often times, many students BS their way through the project for a grade which ends up hurting them in the long run. Take advantage of the fact that you have experts like your professor and TAs to support you and make sure you understand the project very well.

On my resume, I like to briefly describe the project, including what it does and what features it has. Then, I mention what/how I built it. Depending on how much space, I go more in-depth on the project, targetting the content on the jobs I'm applying for. 

I also name my projects, some of them have their own names if they were hackathon submissions or products I designed, but others are just pure fun and I don't really have a name in mind. When this is the case, I just throw the word "epic" in front of what I built. For example, I'm designing a buck converter, so I call it "Epic Buck Converter" on my resume to make it sound at least 483x cooler. 

## Target Your Resumes

As usual, EE is a big field and one resume may be good for chip-level analog design in the semiconductor industry, but it may not fair as well for FPGA RTL roles. If you have the resume budget, it's typically recommended to target your resumes for specific roles, industries, and/or disciplines to maximize your fit. 

I typically don't individually tailor each and every resume I send out, that would be impractical for the 300+ applications I've sent out this season. I usually hand tailor for roles I'm really interested in, but every other role I apply to gets a "general tailored" resume. I have a general EE resume that I send out to general EE roles, but for roles that indicate a focus on power electronics, board design, or my other strengths get a resume dedicated to that. Be sure to find a balance between targetting your resumes and applying. Targetting every single resume will impact on the number of applications you send out and this tradoff might not always be worth it.

I have an "everything" resume that just has every single bullet point, project, and skill I can even put on a resume. If you're reading this on my blog, you can find my everything resume next to my other resumes in the About section on the home page. It ends up being pretty long, so I cut and trim points to tailor to a specific role/discipline. My customized resumes are just pre-cut versions of my everything resume. I tailor these resumes at the beginning of the application season but sort of leave it at that and don't really touch it again. I have like ten of these resumes that are all descendants of the 'everything' resume, so I make sure to double check that resume like 80 times to make sure it's all good. I don't want to have to individually tweak typos on ten resumes when I find an issue. 

If you don't have tons of resume budget, there are still tons of minor tweaks you can make. For example, my resumes for online applications have the education section on top, but my career fair resumes have education at the bottom because it's the career fair, the recruiter/hiring manager knows that it's Cal Poly and I typically indicate my major/year during my elevator pitch. 

If you're applying to opportunies in the US, unfortunately there's lots of bias agianst foreign-sounding names. This obviously shouldn't be the case, but often times it is and if you're getting frustrating results, try changing your name on your resume to a more "western" sounding name and you'd be surprised at the results. I hear of people changing their name on their resume to their more western "nickname" and getting way more callbacks and interviews. It's unfortunate but that's just how it is sometimes. 

I also use different fonts depending on my resume context. When reading a physical, paper copy, I use a font like Times New Roman because apparently studies show it's easier for people to read physically. For online resumes, I use Arial because those studies also show that fonts like Arial are easer to read on computers/screens. I'm not sure how much this actually matters and I stopped doing it because it got annoying given how many resume variants I maintain, but it's something I was taught in my tech writing class that may come in handy. 

## Leverage Industry Nomenclature

To better target my resume and also get a good idea of what's out there, I use words and phrases directly from the job listing. The listing words are generally a baseline of what's expected/desired for the role and leveraging those terms can help to artificially display that you're a good fit. 

These listings are also pretty reflective of the desired skills in the market and can serve as a great guideline on what to explore and learn moving forward but also what to expect from that internship and see how well it aligns with your interests and goals. 

Many postings are pretty generic, especially for the postings that aren't position-specific. They know that interns don't have too much experience so postings often list generic/non-technical skills like "teamwork" and "hardworking" and obviously these aren't going to be the buzzwords I add to my resume. My manager at Apple suggested using job postings for more experienced engineers to identify the market trajectory and valuable skills. I also use those postings to inspire my resume content. If I match the desired skillset for senior roles, that would make be perfect for my internship too! This is even better if the internship posting also has a FTE posting counterpart so I know the exact skillset they're looking for in FTEs. 

## Resume Feedback

You should be continuously updating your resume, it's not a write-once-and-forget sort of thing. After an initial write/overhaul, proofreads, and a healthy amount of edits, share you resume with your friends, professors, your school's career services center, industry connections, and even online to get feedback. There's a good chance they have some opinions to share that you can take and implement as you see fit. 

When sharing your resume for review online by strangers, its obviously a good idea to censor out some private info. There are a ton of online communites to give and receive personalized resume feedback, like [r/EngineeringResumes](https://reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/) and [r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kg3uv8/resume_advice_thread_december_19_2020/) [resume](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kdhljw/resume_advice_thread_december_15_2020/) [advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kbldm8/resume_advice_thread_december_12_2020/) [threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k73nru/resume_advice_thread_december_05_2020/) (keeping in mind that the latter is primarily focused for SWEs). People also post on their engineering subreddits for advice, but that isn't the primary purpose. 

I'd also recommend checking out [Resume Worded](https://resumeworded.com/), a super cool free site that uses AI to provide tailored feedback. 

## Real-World Feedback Loop

Ok now with your resumed reviewed and as solid as possible, it's time to put it out there. But even now, your resume still has room to improve and possibly the best feedback you can get is from those actually reviewing your resume and deciding how to proceed. There's obviously the easy way, directly ask your interviewers/recruiter on resume feedback, but this does't always work because most of the time, you get ghosted or rejected without ever seeing the anyone. I've sent out ~300 applications this season with only sixteen of these landing me interviews, that's a response rate of ~5%, only sixteen opportunies to actually get human feedback from the inside. 

Despite this, I can still use all of these rejections to continue to improve my resume. I play around with my resume, sending a few out and see how those fair. If I don't hear anything back after 50+ resumes, that points to an issue with my resume and I need to figure out what went wrong. This obviously isn't the best way to improve your resume, but it's certainly better than nothing. 

When you do get face-to-face (or zoom-to-zoom now) conversations with your hiring managers/recruiters, there are other ways to get valuable feedback without directly asking them. Notice where how your conversation evolves and what topics are being brought up, especially when in reference to your resume content. If over many interviews, your Arduino project gets brought up a lot, that may be a good sign to emphasize it more and de-emphasize other projects to dedicate more space for that Arduino project. If your that Arduino project comes up more often than your coding teacher job, that may also be a good sign to restructure your resume and put that Arduino project before the coding teacher job. 

Also notice what's not being mentioned. If no one talks about your robotics club from high school, that may be a good sign that it's not as significant as you thought it was. Your resume has very limited real estate and every line is extremely valueable so you want to pack as much as possible. 

But before you start gutting stuff out left and right, be sure to get a wide sample size to make sure your experience actually reflects what's out there. If most of your interviewers are on power electronics team, you might not get as much attention on your digital design projects. If you're shooting for power electronics roles, that may be a good sign to remove to re-evaluate that digital design project, but if you're just looking for general EE roles, leaving that digital project would probably be a good iea. 

In my experience, I noticed that my SWE internship wasn't being mentioned as much, it at all. This was expected, but I didn't anticipate that internship to get as little attention as it did. I actually went ahead and moved my EE internship to the top and cut down my SWE internship down to 2-3 lines to give more space for my EE internship to shine. There's also the general rule to put most recent experience at the top, but I've found great success bending that a bit in this situation. 

## Applicant Tracking System (ATS) Optimization

Many larger companies simply receive too many applications to read and manage each one, so they use Application Tracking Systems (ATS). ATS can parse your resume to look for keywords, for example, and see if you meet some sort of bar there. If you indicated that you're not a US citizen for a defense role, there's a good chance the ATS will auto-reject you. 

ATSs are necessary for big companies like Google and Apple who receive a few million applications every year for only a couple thousand spots, so it definitely makes sense to have that process be automated. ATSs may not be as much a concern with smaller companies, though I don't have too much legitimate data to back that up. I think some recruiting software like Lever do have some ATS capabilities and Lever is often used by smaller companies as well.

Most interns and even hiring managers aren't too involved on the ATS side of things, so my information on this won't be as thorough simply because I don't have much background on it. That being said, there still are ways to optimize your profile to best improve your chances through the ATS and get your resume in front of real eyes. The ATS or other computerized systems may filter out profiles and even reject them automatically without your profile ever seeing the light of day, so that's why it's critical to make sure your profile is ATS-ready.

The first thing I'd recommend is to avoid fancy formatting like tables and two-column layouts. These look really nice on paper to our eyes, but ATS don't have eyes and it can be difficult for them to parse through unusual text. 

Unfortunately, it's much more difficult to test how well your profile is received by an ATS, especially from the outside as an applicant. You can't ask the ATS 'hey! why'd you reject me?!'. Luckily, there are a few tools to help characterize how well a computer can analyze your resume. There's of course [Resume Worded](https://resumeworded.com/) and a few others like [cvlizer](https://www.joinvision.com/en/products/cvlizer/), but there aren't too many out there and I'm not sure how well they compare to what companies actually use. Alternatively, you can leverage job applications that auto-fill fields after uploading your resume like Workday and Taleo and see how those do. 

## Skills Section

A dedicated section to list your skills helps to pass the ATS's buzzword analysis and I'd recommend throwing adding this section into your resume. It's more applicable for engineering resumes and I see it very often on SWE resumes where it's important to highlight their languages, framworks, libraries, and technologies. For EE, it's not as important but it's still very helpful. 

A lot of the content in this section has come up again and again during interviews for me, it's one of those sections I continue to craft based on my recruiting experiences. I've been through a few interviews where my interviewer was asking me questions directly on the keywords I had under my skills section, I saw them circling and dotting right in that section lol. EE is a big field and many interviewers don't want to ask you stuff they know you don't know. Adding a "relevant coursework" list can help, but there are many common interview skills and topics that typically aren't covered in class so this skills section is a quick way to highlight some skills you have outside the classroom and demonstrate your strengths. 

When first starting out on this section, I like to divide up between HW and SW skills. I list good SW skills that crossover to HW like C, C++, Python, and Matlab. I try to keep it under one line because my resume is HW focused, SW skills are just the cherry on top. 

Then I list off my HW skills and topics I'm very comfortable with like I2C, SPI, UART, buck converters, motor drives, etc. If I see that many points can be catagorized into its own group, I do that. On my resume, I have a dedicate list for power electronics to include stuff like LiPo batteries, motor drives, buck converters, LDOs, etc. Most of the things I list here are more practical, but some good school material you can put include: controls, circuits, computer architecture, assembly, digital design, signal processing, MOSFETs, TTL/CMOS, transmision lines, etc. 

I typically don't add a dedication list for equipment/software, but I see it a few times. If you have experience with scopes, DMMs, VNAs, power supplies, etc. or Eagle, Cadence, Altium, Matlab, etc, it could be a good idea to list them. I actually found out recently that many schools don't have too much hands-on lab experience with this sort of equipment/software, so listing these could give you a leg up above those other students. 

Like everything else on your resume though, but sure to list things that you're comfortable with because this is basically a list of what the interview should grill you on. If you find that some items on your list are harder than expected, that's a good sign to remove it or review the material. 

Of course don't lie. Your "thermoquantum electromagenonized MUUGUFET circuits" might impress a clueless recruiter, but good luck talking about random nonsense with an engineer who actually knows what they're doing. One time when I was like ten, I saw my dad working on some resume/job stuff and noticed some random technical term and askin him what it was. He said he made it up to get past recruiters or something, but I still to this day don't know if he was serious about that or if he just didn't want to explain some technical stuff to a ten-year-old.

# Cover Letters

I'm going to be honest, I've only written two cover letters in my entire life, and they were both for summer jobs in high school. I've never written cover letters when applying to internships, it's just not practical for 300+ applications. Most positions that I apply to don't even have places to upload them and they're rarely even looked at from my understanding. Unless your industry requires it or you really want to go the extra mile, I'd advise against cover letters for the sake of time.

# LinkedIn

LinkedIn can be a very powerful tool to help you in your job search. I don't use LinkedIn too much for my search, so I can't provide too many insights there. I've only landed one or two interviews on LinkedIn and I haven't had any luck reaching out to recruiters either. Maybe it's because of my atrocious LinkedIn profile picture, but that's literally a meme and this point and must be preserved. If you're looking to leverage LinkedIn in your internship search (which I'd highly recommend!), you may need to look elsewhere to get more valuable and actionable information. 

I have used LinkedIn to apply for a few jobs via LinkedIn Jobs, it offers a nice list of internship postings all compiled in one location which helps a ton with convenience. 

LinkedIn can also be helpful to expand your network. I've had someone reach out to me to talk about my internship experience and I was more than happy to help out with that. I hear of people reaching out to engineers and recruiters in a company they're interested and many times, there won't be a response but that one response can be all you need to get your foot in the door to land that internship. 

People often post their application and interview experience, offering helpful tips and advice that I may not have personally experienced or covered here. There are LinkedIn "influencers" who offer periodic content because they also know how difficult the job market can be. The big one I see is Wonsulting/Jonathan Javier + Jerry Lee, they often post tons of awesome content to help students land internships/jobs, a lot of which I don't cover here because I haven't experienced it myself.

I've had interviewers and recruiters view my LinkedIn profile, but I suspect those were through online applications I sent out. If my interviews/screenings went well, I usually add my interviewer on LinkedIn as well. I'm actually not sure how normal this is, but most of them do end up accepting my requests and I do this because I genuinley want to connect with them. 

I suppose I could reach out to those interviewers in the future, but I don't think I've ever done that before. I usually have my recruiters' emails which since that's our primary point of contact and if I need to get in touch, it happens through email. If I'm trying to find an entry point into a company, I think the recruiter is a better for that instead of the interviewer. 

In terms of career opportunies over LinkedIn, on of my intern friends at Apple actually landed his internship through LinkedIn. He was interning at another company in SV at the time and an interviewer reached out to him over LinkedIn over the summer to attend basically a mini Apple career fair at one of Apple's campuses. He ended up getting the internship! (well I sorta spoiled that part). LinkedIn is very powerful, but I have yet to unlock its full power. 

# Personal Website

I'm actually not sure how much my personal website helps in terms of the application process, but I think my website is baller af and I'd highly suggest building one yourself if you have the time. If you're reading this on my website, feel free to check out the main page by navigating to "Home" in the navbar to check it out. I think my website deserves a few blog dedicated blog posts, so this section will just focus briefly how it helps the application. 

I like to think of my website like an extended, more personalized resume. It's sort of like a resume in that it only helps me land the interview, but it won't carry me to the offer. It has almost everything I've ever done which would normally fill multiple resumes. It also has tons of pictures and visuals so the potential interviewers can actually see what I'm up to. It's also more personalized because it's *my* website. Of course I remain professional, but a lot of my descriptions have more me to them. Check out the "About Me" or "Experience" section for an example. I wouldn't necessarily put stuff like that on my resume, but for my personal website, it's totally fine. 

Many of my interviewers have actually checked out out my personal website and my company's website prior to our interviews and mention it which just feels awesome. They actually get to see my pictures of my project and explore my ~40 projects beyond those 2-3 I include on my resume. 

Unless you run some hate website or something, a personal website can only help your application, but it takes a lot of time and effort to build and maintain, especially if you don't already have the skillset. Personal websites are more important for SWEs, but even for them it's not that important. Don't feel at all like you need to have a personal website, it's nice icing on the cake but it's probably one of the weakest points of my profile. I'm the only EE student I know that runs and maintains their own website coded from scratch, meaning that literally every other EE student I know has landed amazing internships without a website.

Now with the resume/supplementing resources out of the way, let's get more into the actual meat of your resume, the three pillars of a successful resume: education, experience, and projects. I'm putting projects first because that's typically what you have the most control over. 

# Projects

I can't stress the importance of projects, especially for underclassmen. Projects help you gain hands-on experience and discover your interests beyond the classroom in a practical context, but more importantly, they're what's going to help you land internships. I guaruntee you my undergrad EE curriculum up until like senior year looks probably about 90% the same as your's, so when all of our coursework look nearly identical, it's up to side projects to differentiate between us. When we finally do have the opportunity do differentiate ourselves in the form of coursework, it's probably going to be late in your junior year through senior year, way too late for internships (unless you plan on graduate studies). 

We're lucky that it's relatively easy to get hands-on experience through personal and class projects as an EE, especially when you have university resources like professors, TAs, labs, other motivated students, etc. It may not be as easy as CS, but it sure is much easier than say nuclear engineering or physics. 

If you don't have much work experience, don't be afraid to dedicate the bulk of your resumes to projects. Side projects are more than enough to land internships even if you're "only a first year" and they don't need to be substantial. My flagship side project that helped me land my first internship at Apple during my first quarter at school was a simple little motor drive PCB I designed for my Nerf blasters. 

Projects are super important, but if you're getting overwhelmed with school and other obligations, don't feel that you *need* projects to succeed. Many students waste their college education playing video games and end up fine, projects are just another way to boost your resume to the next level to tackle the more competitive internships. If you're aiming for companies like Apple and Nvidia with no projects (or experience) under your belt, well good luck with that, but there are still many amazing opportunities that don't necessarily require projects. 

## Personality Through Projects

It's not always the fact that you have side projects that's most important, but your personal qualities that get demonstrated just by having them. Building your side projects in addition to the EE courseload shows a lot of dedication and initiative. EE is tough and squeezing in projects on top of your classes isn't easy. You probably don't know everything you need to know for the project, so you'll need to learn it on the fly and this again reflects very well in your favor. If you just have the standard EE courses and nothing else, it's really difficult to display these traits, you just look the same as every other EE student on paper. 

When I was walking through my motor drive PCB project with a hiring manager from Apple at the career fair during my first quarter, he was impressed that I even had projects, given that I was a freshman, let alone a full PCB that I owned end-to-end. What impressed him even more was how well I knew the ins-an-outs of my projects, from the MOSFET design and operation to the PCB layout and LiPo battery behavior and that I learned all of these on my own in high school. These demostrated a great deal of initiative, determination, persistence, passion, and technical capability that helped me not only land the initial interview, but also succeed in those interviews and during the internship. If I just had the project but not any of the background, I'm not sure I would've secured that internship. 

These traits that get demonstrated by having side projects are also the same traits that drive a successful engineer. An interviewer/hiring manager/recruiter knows this and looks for this in addition to a strong technical background. For your hyper-competitive internships, these are almost a given among the successful applicants and are almost required. For other internships that may not be as competitive, a strong academic background may suffice so don't feel that you're unworthy without side projects! They help *a lot*, but there are definitely opportunies out there that don't necessarily "require" them. Your coursework should almost always come first, so it might not always be worth it to sacrifice your grades for a few projects. 

## Developing a Focus

Aside from internships, projects are one of the best ways to develop your EE focus and where to target your career, especially because you can do them on your own/with friends on the side. Want to get into power electronics? Design your own buck converter on a PCB. Want to get into computer architecture? Design your own RISC V core. Want to get into robotics? Design your own motor controller. I can go on and on, but you get the idea. 

Many schools offer technical electives to help focus your studies on a particular topic, but those may not be available until later on, maybe too late to be leveraged for the internship search. With only the standard EE classes under your belt, your side projects tell that recruiter or hiring manager what your interests and skillsets are so they can best match you accordingly. 

## Developing your Technical Toolkit

When you're building your projects, there's a good chance your classes didn't teach you everything about everything and you'll need to do a ton of digging on your own. You'll learn a lot and all these information and skills you're picking up won't go to waste. Projects aid your resume, they'll help you get the interview but won't carry you through the interviews, but that's where all that experience from your projects come into play. All that extra reading and self teaching, even the information that isn't implemented in your projects, can come into play during the interviews and will also rollover into the internship. 

I hope nearly 1000 words on the significance of projects helps to convice you to do your own projects (hint: prjects are super important!). Now, I'll go over more on that *what you can do* side of the projects and how to make the most of them. 

## Starting Off

## Arduino

Here are a few tips to those of you starting early. I was also in your shoes and there are tons of resources out there to teach yourself. I may dedicate an entire separate post for this, but here are some quick tips. I'd recommend getting started with Arduino to get your feet wet in electronics and coding. Don't be afraid to code! It's an awesome skill actually make electronics so much easier for you. Try to get a simple Arduino starter kit, you can find them online for as cheap as $20-$30 although there are many fancier kits out there. 

Start small, find an online tutorial to hold your hand, first at blinking an LED, then learn how to use buttons. Learn the fundementals as you go, *why* are things happening the way they are? When you decrease the resistance, why does the LED get brighter? No need to get into any of that complex math, a conceptual understanding is solid. Start working with cool peripherals like sensors, screens, motors, etc. and you basically know enough to make your own game! 

## Google it!

Don't be afraid to Google stuff! If you don't have a technical mentor, it can be intimitating but Google everything! Run into a coding bug? Google it! Want to learn how to use a sensor? Google it!! You have almost everyting known to man at your fingertips. This skill to Google search everything isn't as intuitive as you may think but it will stick with you for the rest of your life. Knowing that the world gets so much smaller when you utilize Google is reassuring. At first, it will be challenging but soon it becomes second nature and your most valuable skill. I recommended Arduino because there are tons of online resources and forums, so when you Google stuff, you'll actually find it! Then, as you move into more complex topics where the Google searches aren't as nice, you'll have the background and intuition on how to navigate the results and find what you need. 

## Your First PCB!

Now that you have a cool project, time to make it robust and mobile on its own PCB! PCBs are awesome projects and there are tons of resources online to hold your hand along the way. There are tons of services to make PCBs for you that are quick and affordable. And plus, they make killer resume projects that you can show off at your interviews!

## Find Your Passion

But ultimately, the most important thing about starting early is finding your passion. Maybe after a few projects, you find that EE isn't for you, coding is way more fun. It's way better to figure that out over a $20 kit and a few hours of your time, that beats $50,000 and a few semesters at school. Many students enter EE not knowing exactly what they want to do and after a few EE classes, they find out that EE isn't for them. I think something like 60-70% of EEs transfer out of the program and I'd rather sacrifice a few hours of my own time in middle school to figure that out. 

But maybe you do find out that EE is your passion - even better! My passion in EE is one of the best things that happened to me, it's the intersection between a great career, doing what I love, and amazing pay. When you're truely passionate about something, you will get good at it and you will dedicate all your time and effort into it. Don't have time? Your passion will find you time.
