# Final Thoughts

Remember, landing an internship is tough. As of writing this, I've sent out 300+ applications and haven't even secured an offer yet. Sure, internships have tons of benefits, but it's not the end of the world of you don't land one. I know tons of people who didn't land internships in school and they're doing great now. Don't get discouraged and keep moving forward! Throughout the application process, even if you get rejected hundreds of times, you're still becoming an even stronger applicant. You'll develop a valuable skillset on navigating the application process that will be utilized again and again and no one can ever take that from you.

# Appendix

- AFUNGALMASS - Yet another acronym for top tech companies: Amazon, Facebook, Uber, Netflix, Google, Apple, Lyft, Microsoft, AirBnB, Stripe, Snap. Techies are obsessed with "top companies" and "tiers" and try to cram more and more companies into the "top tier" by appending random letters to the end of FAANG like this: FAANGTLLAUMSDRDR (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google, Twitter, Lyft, LinkedIn, AirBnB, Uber, Microsoft, Snap, Datadog, Roblox, Doordash, Robinhood) and it's basically a meme, hence "a fungal mass". This is the term I use the most.
- ATS - Applicant Tracking System: Software implemented to track, filter, etc applicants.
- Big N - Another reference to the same top tech companies: Yes those techies need this many ways to refer to the same few companies. Big N is wider and more flexible in that the companies aren't "hardcoded" in a pronouncable acronym.
- CoL - Cost of Living: How expensive it is to live somewhere. High CoL includes SV/California, New York, etc. Lower CoL includes Wyoming, Arkansas, etc. TC is typically scaled with CoL. [Here's a nice website to characterize CoL.](https://www.bestplaces.net/)
- CS - Computer Science
- CE/CPE - Computer Engineering: Typically a mix of EE and CS, other schools may refer to this as EECS
- ECE - Electrical and Computer Engineering
- EE - Electrical Engineer/Engineering
- EECS - Electrical Enginering and Computer Science: Other schools may refer to this as CPE/CE
- FAANG - Acronym for top tech companies: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google. This term originates from finance that captured the fastest growing stocks at the time and just found its way over to tech. It also represents other top-paying tech companies because no one wants to memorize a voltaile achronym that changes three times a day.
- FAANGMULAS - Another acronym for top tech companies: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Microsoft, Uber, Lyft, Stripe.
- FTE/FT - Full-Time Engineer/Full-Time
- HFT - High-Frequency Trading: The small industry that uses algorithms and software to make money by predicting the stock market. I use it synonomously with quant, hedge funds, and prop shops because I really don't know the difference. They're known to offer wicked salaries but are very competitive with limited seats because of the small industry size.
- HR - Human Resources: The part of a company that deals with recruiting and other people stuff.
- HWE/HW - Hardware Engineer/Hardware: Can refer to EEs or MEs and EEs, but I use it here to mean EE
- HYPSM - Acronym to refer to the top schools: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, MIT. Fun fact, it's pronounced "hip-sum".
- [LC - Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/): A website to practice coding questions/riddles/interviews. SWE interviews are often word for word LC problems or at least very very similar and there's a massive content disconnect between LC/coding interviews and the actual job. EEs don't have a similar alternative.
- NG - New Grad: A recent grad/soon to graduate. The hiring process is typically handled by the same group of people that handle intern hiring, university relations (UR).
- SV - Silicon Valley: The geographical area around the San Francisco Bay Area in California. Home to a ton of tech companies and this area in general for other companies typically offers the highest TC to compensate for the expensive CoL.
- SWE/SW - Software Engineer/Software
- [TC - Total Compensation](https://www.levels.fyi/blog/what-is-total-compensation.html): The total amount of money you're making, including stock, signing/starting bonuses, relocation, and other bonuses.
- UR - Unveristy Relations: A dedicated division of HR to handle the recruiting of NGs and interns. At big companies, there are dedicated teams separate from experienced/industry hires, but at smaller companies, this may not be the case. 
- YoE - Years of Experience: Typically doesn't include internships, masters or PhD's may get 1-2 extra years
