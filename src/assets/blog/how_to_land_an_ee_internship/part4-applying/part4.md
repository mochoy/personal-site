- trap: need to apply early, but feel won't have enough exp
- Up to you, if you have no projects or prior experience, it might be better use of time to work on projects
- I can't provide a good balance there
- Send out applications, if hear nothing back, work on some projects
- Be careful where sending out applications if you're just testing the waters
- Emails to track where appliyng
- When hear back?
- Apply multiple roles at same company, can interview for multiple roles or sometimes better chance
- Keep track of things, they can be useful later on: Recruiters, where/when apply
- For first internship, need to go for everything, don't turn down interview offers, it's still a great learning opportunity. Get the offer first, then decide
  - I see a lot of people say, "Recruiter just reached out to inverview for X but I don't like the company, should I still interview?" Do it!
  - Things change when you actually get the offer letter
- If already accepted another offer but get chance to interview with another company, what do to?
  - Interview with new company
  - Reneg old company
  - Not as high priority though since you already have an offer
- Follow up if not calling you during interview time
- Let other companies know who you're in the loops with
  - They dont care that you got rejected or anything from another company
- Use autofill tool to help autofill stuff, I use https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/autofill/nlmmgnhgdeffjkdckmikfpnddkbbfkkk
- Types of applications
  - General/pool
  - Role-specific
- Applying online is largely inevitable, but increase chances through connections, direct contact
