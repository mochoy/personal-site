## Total Compensation (TC)
the total amount of money you're making, including stock, signing/starting bonuses, and other bonuses. These components can be more than 2x your 100k+ salary as a NG and continues to grow as you progress in your career, so salary typically isn't entirely reflective of how much you're actually making. Some industries are more salary-focused, others offer tons of other stocks and bonuses. TC typically refers to FTE comp, but it's also used to refer to intern comp because there are a few components that can make up a large portion of TC, including relocation/housing, transportation, and signing bonus. If you're lucky, a lot of this money can be directly pocketed. Typically doesn't include stuff liek 401k, insurance
